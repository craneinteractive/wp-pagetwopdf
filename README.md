# wp-page2pdf

A learning exercise in WordPress plugin development. Allows pages and posts to be converted to PDF with a click of a button.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf">dompdf/dompdf</a> to perform the conversion. Sections of the page can be excluded using CSS classes or IDs - most likely used to exclude headers, footers and sidebars.

This code is not yet production ready. Please **do not use in producton**.
